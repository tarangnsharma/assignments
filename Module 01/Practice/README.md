# Module 01 | Practice

Practice assignments (PC 01–PC 10) and their solutions. This folder is the Flutter app.

## Layout

- **`lib/core/`** – Common code (theme, navigation).
- **`lib/features/pc01_wrap_products/`** … **`lib/features/pc10_grid_layout/`** – Each folder holds **both** the assignment (README + assets) **and** the solution code (presentation, domain).
- **`Module_01_notes.md`** – Notes for the practice assignments.

## Run the app

From this folder (Practice):

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Assignment + solution (per PC)

Each lives in one feature folder under **`lib/features/`**:
