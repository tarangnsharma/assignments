# Module 01 | Graded

Graded assignments (GC 01–GC 05) and their solutions. This folder is the Flutter app.

## Layout

- **`lib/core/`** – Common code (theme, navigation).
- **`lib/features/gc01_web_title/`** … **`lib/features/gc05_longest_word/`** – Each folder holds **both** the assignment (README + assets) **and** the solution code (presentation, domain).
- **`Module_01_Graded_notes.md`** – Notes for the graded assignments.

## Run the app

From this folder (Graded):

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Assignment + solution (per GC)

Each lives in one feature folder under **`lib/features/`**:

| GC  | Feature folder (assignment README + assets + solution code) |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01  | `lib/features/gc01_web_title/`                               |
