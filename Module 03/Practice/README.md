# Module 03 | Practice

Practice assignments (PC 21–PC 30) and their solutions. This folder is the Flutter app.

## Layout

- **`lib/core/`** – Common code (theme, navigation).
- **`lib/features/home/`** – Home screen listing all assignments and navigating to each.
- **`lib/features/pc21_drawing_app/`** … **`lib/features/pc30_text_form_field/`** – Each folder holds **both** the assignment (README + assets when present) **and** the solution code (presentation, domain if used).
- **`Module_03_notes.md`** – Notes for the practice assignments.

## Run the app

From this folder (Practice):

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
